# AIR Visualizer

Visualize AIR constraints defined using plonky3. The AIR constraints are visualized as an AST using the graphviz format.

Boolean (selectors) are colored in red, trace variables are colored in green, constants are colored in blue.

Here is an example of the AIR constraints visualization implementing the [Fibonacci](https://github.com/BrianSeong99/Plonky3_Fibonacci) sequence:
